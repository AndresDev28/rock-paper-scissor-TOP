Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is my first Rock-Paper-Scissors project created using JavaScript. I built it after learning the basic concepts of the language through The Odin Project's free course.

Currently, the game runs within the console web browser. Feel free to try it out!  If you have any suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to share them.

Thanks for checking it out!
